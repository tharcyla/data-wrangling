    "## Introduction to Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is about getting data read so that anything created is built on a solid foundation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many contexts, uncleaned or poorly cleaned data can lead to major impacts. In a drug company, for instance, data wrangling can be literally life or death. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps to data wrangling:\n",
    "1. Gather\n",
    "2. Assess\n",
    "3. Clean\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Gathering Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Gathering is sometimes called acquiring or collecting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the gathering process can vary. Common data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Files\n",
    "2. Database\n",
    "3. Scraped off of website\n",
    "4. Application programming interface (API) which allows us to programmatically access data\n",
    "\n",
    "While files can be downloaded manually, best practices dictates it is actually better to download files programmatically, i.e., with code. There are two reasons for that: scalability and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unzip File\n",
    "[Zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) documentation."

If we're happy with the quality and tidiness of our data, we can end our wrangling process and move on to storing our clean data, or analyzing, visualizing, or modeling it.\n",
