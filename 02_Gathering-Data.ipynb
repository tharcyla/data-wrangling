    "#### Flat File Structure\n",
    "Flat files contain tabular data in plain text format with one data record per line and each record or line having one or more fields. These fields are separated by delimiters, like commas, tabs, or colons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of flat files** include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They're text files and therefore human readable\n",
    "- Lightweight\n",
    "- Simple to understand\n",
    "- Software that can read/write text files is ubiquitous, like text editors\n",
    "- Great for small dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of flat files**, in comparison to relational databases, for example, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of standards\n",
    "- Data redundancy\n",
    "- Sharing data can be cumbersome\n",
    "- Not great for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flat Files in Python\n",
    "Pandas is especially suited to read tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`pandas.read_csv`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) can handle all kinds of flat files, including TSV files by changing the parameters. Try importing the .tsv file based on the Top 100 Movies from RottenTomatoes. "
